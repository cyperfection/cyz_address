What does it do?
----------------
The extension provides a plugin which allows to use fluid templates with tt_address.
It provides the same selection mechanisms as tt_address, the only difference being that only one type of selection is active at a time.

It also features a realurl auto configuration, configurable pages for single and list view action and layout template selection in backend.
